# Merge strategy for files that are purely additive across parallel agent branches.
# The `union` driver takes all lines from both sides — no conflict markers, no loops.
# Used for files where every agent adds unique lines and the result of "keep both"
# is always correct.

# Muse CLI command registry — every new `muse <cmd>` adds import + cli.add_typer().

# Type contracts registry — every new result type adds an entry.
