"""ac_initiative_phases — phase dependency graph per initiative

Stores the DAG of phase dependencies that was declared in the PlanSpec
at plan-creation time.  Each row records one phase of one initiative and
which other phases it must wait for before work can begin.

The Build board reads this table to compute the ``locked`` flag for each
phase swim lane.  When no rows exists for an initiative (e.g. issues were
created before this feature shipped), every phase is shown as unlocked.

Revision ID: ac0003
Revises: ac0002
Create Date: 2026-03-04

DEPRECATED: This table is owned by cgcardona/agentception.
Once AgentCeption runs on its own Postgres instance (issue #965), run
the DROP TABLE cleanup documented in docs/migration.md (issue #966) and
remove this migration file from the Maestro repo. Data migration
decision: DISCARD — ac_initiative_phases data is re-created automatically
on the next Phase 1B planning run. See docs/migration.md for rationale.
