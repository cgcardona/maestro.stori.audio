"""Ticket analyzer for AgentCeption.

Parses an issue body and returns structured recommendations used by the
Eng VP seed loop when generating ``.agent-task`` files.  All heuristics are
intentionally simple and rule-based so that results are deterministic and
testable without a live model call.

Typical usage::

    from agentception.intelligence.analyzer import analyze_issue

    analysis = await analyze_issue(632)
    print(analysis.recommended_role)   # "python-developer"
    print(analysis.parallelism)        # "safe"

    """Structured analysis of a GitHub issue body.

    Produced by :func:`analyze_issue` and consumed by the Eng VP seed loop
    to determine whether an issue is safe to parallelize and which agent role
    should handle it.

    Fields
    ------
    number:
        GitHub issue number that was analysed.
    dependencies:
        Issue numbers declared in the body via ``Depends on #N`` or
        ``Blocked by #N`` patterns (sorted, deduplicated).
    parallelism:
        Whether this issue can safely run alongside others:
        ``"safe"`` — creates only new files, no shared-file risk.
        ``"risky"`` — modifies at least one shared or additive file.
        ``"serial"`` — body explicitly declares this must run alone.
    conflict_risk:
        Estimated merge-conflict risk:
        ``"none"`` — no known conflict-prone files touched.
        ``"low"`` — touches a shared config but not a high-risk additive file.
        ``"high"`` — touches a high-risk additive file (app.py, muse-vcs.md …).
    modifies_files:
        File paths extracted from a ``### Files to Create / Modify`` section.
        Empty list when no such section is present.
    recommended_role:
        Role that should handle this issue:
        ``"database-architect"`` when migrations or Alembic are mentioned.
        ``"python-developer"`` otherwise.
    recommended_merge_after:
        Largest dependency issue number, or ``None`` when there are no deps.
        The Eng VP uses this to defer assignment until the dependency PR merges.
