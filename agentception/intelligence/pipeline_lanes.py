"""Phase gate computation for the pipeline control panel.

Computes gate status (waiting / ready / done) for each phase label in order,
based on the open issues visible in the board and the active agents list.

This is a **pure function module** — no I/O, no side effects.  The route
handler calls :func:`compute_phase_lanes` and injects the result into the
Jinja context.  Keeping gate logic here lets tests verify it without touching
HTTP or template rendering.

Gate semantics
--------------
Given ``labels = [L0, L1, L2, ...]``:

- ``done``    — phase has **0** open issues (all closed or never started).
- ``waiting`` — phase has open issues AND at least one *upstream* phase (earlier
  in the order) also has open issues.  The first upstream blocker is exposed
  as ``blockers``.
- ``ready``   — phase has open issues AND **all** upstream phases are done.
  Work can begin here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels:
        Ordered phase labels from ``active_labels_order`` in the pipeline
        config.  Earlier = upstream.
    board_issues:
        Open issues visible in the board, each carrying a ``phase_label``.
    agents:
        Active agent nodes, each carrying an ``issue_number``.

    Notes
    -----
    - Issues whose ``phase_label`` is absent from *labels* are silently
      ignored; they belong to phases outside the configured order.
    - ``total_count`` equals ``open_count`` because the board only carries
      open issues.  A future enhancement could query closed counts from
      Postgres and pass them in.
