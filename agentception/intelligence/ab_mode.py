"""A/B mode role-file selector for the Engineering VP (AC-504).

When A/B mode is enabled in ``pipeline-config.json``, successive batches
alternate between two role file variants based on whether the BATCH_ID
timestamp second is even (variant A) or odd (variant B).  This provides
a controlled experiment channel: everything about a batch stays constant
except which role prompt governs the agents, so outcomes can later be
correlated against the version that was active.

The BATCH_ID format is ``eng-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSz-<hex>`` (e.g.
``eng-20260302T054843Z-54b3``).  The seconds component (``SS``) is the
digit pair that drives the selection:

    SS % 2 == 0  →  variant A (even)
    SS % 2 == 1  →  variant B (odd)

When A/B mode is disabled, or the BATCH_ID cannot be parsed, the
``default_role_file`` is returned unchanged so the caller's normal flow
is unaffected.

    role_file = await select_role_file(
        batch_id=BATCH_ID,

    """Return the role file path appropriate for this batch.

    Reads ``pipeline-config.json`` to check whether A/B mode is enabled.
    When enabled and the BATCH_ID is parseable, returns either ``variant_a_file``
    (even second) or ``variant_b_file`` (odd second).  Falls back to
    ``default_role_file`` in all other cases:

    - A/B mode is disabled.
    - ``target_role`` does not match this call's context (not checked here —
      the caller is responsible for passing the correct ``default_role_file``
      only when the role matches ``target_role``).
    - Either variant file is ``None`` or empty in the config.
    - ``batch_id`` does not contain a parseable timestamp.

    Parameters
    ----------
    batch_id:
        The BATCH_ID string from ``.agent-task`` (e.g. ``eng-20260302T054843Z-54b3``).
    default_role_file:
        The role file path to use when A/B mode is inactive or cannot be applied.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Absolute or relative path to the role file that should govern this batch.
