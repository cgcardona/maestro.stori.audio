"""UI routes sub-package — replaces the monolithic ``routes/ui.py``.

Each domain module owns a focused set of route handlers and imports only what
it needs.  This ``__init__`` assembles the combined router and re-exports the
shared helpers that ``agentception/routes/api/`` historically imported from the
old ``ui.py`` module.

``app.py`` does ``from agentception.routes.ui import router as ui_router`` — that
import path continues to work unchanged.
