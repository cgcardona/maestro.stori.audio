"""JSON API routes sub-package — replaces the monolithic ``routes/api.py``.

Each domain module owns a focused set of endpoints.  This ``__init__`` assembles
the combined ``/api``-prefixed router and re-exports nothing (the only public
symbol is ``router``).

``app.py`` does ``from agentception.routes.api import router as api_router`` — that
import path continues to work unchanged.
