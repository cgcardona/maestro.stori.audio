"""AgentCeption MCP tools for the Build phase.

These four tools are called by running agents to push structured lifecycle
events back to AgentCeption.  They complement the passive transcript reader
(which captures raw thinking messages) by letting agents proactively signal
intent: what step they're on, when they're blocked, important decisions, and
when they finish.

All four functions are async — they write to ``ac_agent_events`` via the
persist layer and return a lightweight ack dict.
