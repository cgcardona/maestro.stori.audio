# `.agent-task` — Formal TOML Specification

> **Version:** 2.0  
> **Format:** [TOML 1.0](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0)  
> **Parsed by:** `agentception/readers/worktrees.py` (Python `tomllib`, stdlib since 3.11)  
> **Read by:** Cursor's LLM (full raw text as context) + AgentCeption dashboard

---

## Overview

Every agent worktree contains exactly one `.agent-task` file. It is the **single source of
truth** for that agent's assignment, identity, pipeline position, and execution constraints.

Two consumers read this file with different goals:

| Consumer | What it reads | How |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| AgentCeption dashboard | Typed scalar fields for monitoring/telemetry | `tomllib.loads()` → `TaskFile` Pydantic model |
| Cursor's LLM | Full raw text as natural language context | File read → LLM context window |

Because the LLM reads the entire file, **any valid TOML you add is immediately available
to the agent** — even fields AgentCeption doesn't formally parse. This makes the file
extensible at zero cost.

---

## File Layout

```toml
# ── Section order is conventional, not required by TOML ──────────────────────

[task]          # Core identity and lifecycle control
[agent]         # Who is running this task
[repo]          # GitHub and git coordinates
[pipeline]      # Batch/wave/VP lineage for traceability
[spawn]         # Orchestration control: chaining, sub-agents
[target]        # What this task acts on (issue, PR, or custom)
[worktree]      # Local filesystem coordinates
[output]        # Async result rendezvous (for Cursor-driven workflows)
[domain]        # Domain context (non-tech orgs: marketing, legal, ops, etc.)

# ── Optional payload sections (workflow-specific) ─────────────────────────────
[plan_draft]    # WORKFLOW=plan-spec: brain dump dispatch to Cursor
[enriched]      # Coordinator manifest (structured issue set)

# ── Sub-task queues (coordinator and conductor workflows only) ────────────────
[[issue_queue]]         # repeated for each sub-task
[[pr_queue]]            # repeated for each PR review sub-task
[[deliverable_queue]]   # repeated for each non-code deliverable
```

## Field Reference

### `[task]`

Core identity. Required in every task file.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `version` | string | yes | Spec version — always `"2.0"` for TOML files |

| `pr-review` | QA reviewer | Merge + grade |
| `coordinator` | Batch coordinator | N worktrees + N child agents |
| `conductor` | Meta-orchestrator | Pipeline state report |
| `bugs-to-issues` | Issue creator | GitHub issues |
| `plan-spec` | Cursor LLM | YAML PlanSpec written to `output.path` |
| `task-to-deliverable` | Any domain agent | Domain-specific artifact |

**`required_output` values:**

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `pr_url` | Open pull request URL |
| `grade,merge_status,pr_url` | Full review result |

└─ comma-separated figure/archetype IDs (from cognitive_archetypes/figures/)

Examples:
  "turing:python"                     — single figure + one skill

## Parser Contract (AgentCeption)

AgentCeption's `parse_agent_task()` in `agentception/readers/worktrees.py` reads the file
using `tomllib.loads()`. The following fields are formally tracked in the `TaskFile` model
(everything else is available to the LLM but silently ignored by the dashboard):

```
task.workflow → TaskFile.task
task.id → TaskFile.id
task.attempt_n → TaskFile.attempt_n
task.required_output → TaskFile.required_output
task.on_block → TaskFile.on_block
agent.role → TaskFile.role
agent.cognitive_arch → TaskFile.cognitive_arch
agent.session_id → TaskFile.session_id
repo.gh_repo → TaskFile.gh_repo
repo.base → TaskFile.base
pipeline.batch_id → TaskFile.batch_id
pipeline.wave → TaskFile.wave
spawn.mode → TaskFile.spawn_mode
spawn.sub_agents → TaskFile.spawn_sub_agents
target.issue_number → TaskFile.issue_number
target.pr_number → TaskFile.pr_number
target.depends_on → TaskFile.depends_on
target.closes → TaskFile.closes_issues
target.file_ownership → TaskFile.file_ownership
worktree.path → TaskFile.worktree
worktree.branch → TaskFile.branch
worktree.linked_pr → TaskFile.linked_pr
output.draft_id → TaskFile.draft_id
output.path → TaskFile.output_path
domain.name → TaskFile.domain
```

### Backwards compatibility

Files that still use the old `KEY=value` flat format (v1) are detected by the absence
of a `[task]` table header. The parser falls back to the legacy line-split parser for
these files. All newly written files must use TOML (v2). The legacy parser is removed
once all coordinator prompts are updated to write TOML.

## Extension Guide

### Adding a new workflow type

1. Add a row to the **Workflow types** table above.
2. Add a `[[workflow_name_queue]]` section if it needs sub-task coordination.
3. Add any workflow-specific payload section (`[workflow_name_payload]`).
4. Add the new workflow's `required_output` value to the table.
5. Update `agentception/models.py` `TaskFile` with any new fields the dashboard needs.
6. Update the coordinator prompt that writes this workflow's task files.

### Adding a new domain (non-tech org)

1. Add an entry to `org-presets.yaml` with the domain's role topology.
2. Add role files to `.cursor/roles/` for any new roles.
3. Add cognitive architecture figures/skills to `scripts/gen_prompts/cognitive_archetypes/`
   if the domain has domain-specific figures (e.g., `ogilvy.yaml` for marketing).
4. Set `domain.name` and `domain.org_preset` in the task file.
5. No code changes needed — the domain context flows through the LLM's prompt.
