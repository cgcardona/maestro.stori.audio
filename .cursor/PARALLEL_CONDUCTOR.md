# Parallel Agent Conductor — Full Pipeline Orchestration

> ## YOU ARE THE META-ORCHESTRATOR
>
> If you are an AI agent reading this document, your role is **conductor only**.
>
> **Your job — the full list, nothing more:**
> 1. Close any stale `conductor-reminder` issues from the previous run.
> 2. Clean up orphaned worktrees left by crashed agents.
> 3. Query GitHub to reconstruct full pipeline state from labels and PR status.
> 4. Resolve the dependency graph — determine which batches can advance right now.
> 5. Dispatch the correct canonical coordinator for each ready batch, simultaneously.
> 6. Collect coordinator reports and verify artifact proof.
> 7. Create a `conductor-reminder` issue if the pipeline is not idle.
>
> **You do NOT:**
> - Implement any feature yourself.
> - Review any PR yourself.
> - Create any GitHub issue yourself (other than the reminder).
> - Run mypy or pytest yourself.
> - Hardcode batch or issue numbers — **GitHub label state is the single source of truth**.
>
> The coordinators you dispatch read their own canonical prompts.
> You do not rewrite those prompts or duplicate their logic.

## Why the conductor exists

The three canonical prompts (BUGS_TO_ISSUES, ISSUE_TO_PR, PR_REVIEW) are stage-specific.
Each requires a human to decide when to run it, which batch to target, and whether
dependencies are met. The conductor removes that human bottleneck.

A single conductor invocation:
1. Reads all pipeline state from GitHub labels.
2. Determines which batches are ready (dependencies satisfied).
3. Dispatches ISSUE_TO_PR and PR_REVIEW coordinators **simultaneously** for all ready batches.
4. Leaves a reminder if work remains so the next run is obvious.

The conductor does not loop — it makes one full pass, then creates a reminder.
Re-run it once per development session or whenever a human decides to advance the pipeline.

---

## Pipeline State Model

Pipeline state lives entirely in GitHub. No external database, no sidecar files.

### Source of truth signals

| Signal | How to read it |
|--------|---------------|
| Open issues with `batch-NN` label | Issues not yet implemented — ready for ISSUE_TO_PR |
| Open PRs linked to `batch-NN` issues | PRs awaiting review — ready for PR_REVIEW |
| Closed issues | Implemented and merged |
| Open issues with `status/in-progress` | ISSUE_TO_PR agent currently working |
| Open PRs with `status/pr-open` | PR_REVIEW agent dispatched but not yet merged |
| `conductor-reminder` issue open | Pipeline was incomplete on last conductor run |

### Phase dependency order

Phases must be completed in order. Within a phase, all batches run in parallel.

```
phase-1/db-schema      →  phase-2/core-api      →  phase-3/api-extensions
phase-4/new-ui-pages   →  phase-5/ui-enhancements
phase-6/seed-data      →  phase-7/machine-access
```

A batch is "ready" if:
- Its phase's predecessor phase has all issues closed (merged), AND
- It has open issues (ISSUE_TO_PR) or open PRs (PR_REVIEW).

⚠️  **Human approval gates** — these batches require explicit human sign-off before dispatch:
- Any batch in `phase-1/db-schema` containing an Alembic migration — migration chains
  must be audited for MERGE_AFTER ordering before parallel review.
- Any issue or PR labeled `security`.
- Any PR that modifies `maestro/protocol/events.py` (SSE contract — Swift frontend impact).

## Setup — run this once to create the conductor worktree

```bash
REPO=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
PRTREES="$HOME/.cursor/worktrees/$(basename "$REPO")"
mkdir -p "$PRTREES"
cd "$REPO"

export GH_REPO=cgcardona/maestro

# Snapshot dev tip
DEV_SHA=$(git rev-parse dev)

WT="$PRTREES/conductor"
if [ -d "$WT" ]; then
  echo "⚠️  conductor worktree already exists — remove it first or re-use:"
  echo "    git worktree remove --force $WT && git worktree prune"
  exit 1
fi
git worktree add --detach "$WT" "$DEV_SHA"

# Write the conductor task file.
# PHASE_FILTER: leave empty to run the full pipeline, or set to a single phase
# label (e.g. phase-3/api-extensions) to limit scope to one phase.
cat > "$WT/.agent-task" << TASKEOF
WORKFLOW=conductor
GH_REPO=$GH_REPO
PHASE_FILTER=
MAX_ISSUES_PER_DISPATCH=12
MAX_PRS_PER_DISPATCH=12
ATTEMPT_N=0
REQUIRED_OUTPUT=pipeline_status_report
ON_BLOCK=escalate
TASKEOF

echo "✅ conductor worktree ready: $WT"
git worktree list
```

After running, launch the conductor agent with the **Kickoff Prompt** below.

## Kickoff Prompt

```
PARALLEL AGENT COORDINATION — PIPELINE CONDUCTOR

Read .cursor/AGENT_COMMAND_POLICY.md before issuing any shell commands.
Green-tier commands run without confirmation. Yellow = check scope first.
Red = never, ask the user instead.

STEP 0 — READ YOUR TASK FILE:
  cat .agent-task

  Parse all KEY=value fields:
    GH_REPO                → GitHub repo slug (always cgcardona/maestro)
    PHASE_FILTER           → restrict to one phase, or empty for all
    MAX_ISSUES_PER_DISPATCH → cap on parallel ISSUE_TO_PR agents (safety valve)
    MAX_PRS_PER_DISPATCH   → cap on parallel PR_REVIEW agents (safety valve)
    ATTEMPT_N              → how many times conductor has run without progress

  Export:
    export GH_REPO=$(grep "^GH_REPO=" .agent-task | cut -d= -f2)
    export GH_REPO=${GH_REPO:-cgcardona/maestro}
    PHASE_FILTER=$(grep "^PHASE_FILTER=" .agent-task | cut -d= -f2)
    ATTEMPT_N=$(grep "^ATTEMPT_N=" .agent-task | cut -d= -f2)

  ⚠️  ANTI-LOOP GUARD: if ATTEMPT_N > 3 → STOP.
    This conductor has run 4+ times without advancing the pipeline.
    Something is systematically wrong (label misconfiguration, GitHub API failure,
    all remaining issues blocked on human-gated dependencies, etc.).
    Create a GitHub issue:
      gh issue create --repo "$GH_REPO" \
        --title "⚠️ Conductor stuck: ATTEMPT_N=$ATTEMPT_N — needs human intervention" \
        --body "The pipeline conductor has run $(( ATTEMPT_N )) times without advancing.
  Possible causes:
  - All remaining batches have unresolved DEPENDS_ON dependencies
  - All remaining PRs are in D/F grade rejection state
  - Label misconfiguration (phase/batch labels missing or wrong)
  - GitHub API failures
  
  Run: gh issue list --repo $GH_REPO --label 'conductor-reminder' --state open
  "
    Then self-destruct and escalate to the user.

STEP 1 — STALE STATE CLEANUP (always run first):
  # 1a. Close stale conductor-reminder issues (they're outdated by this new run)
  STALE_REMINDERS=$(gh issue list --repo "$GH_REPO" \
    --label "conductor-reminder" --state open --json number --jq '.[].number' 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$STALE_REMINDERS" ]; then
    echo "$STALE_REMINDERS" | tr ',' '\n' | xargs -I{} gh issue close {} \
      --comment "Superseded by new conductor run. New reminder will be created if pipeline is still incomplete." \
      --repo "$GH_REPO" 2>/dev/null || true
    echo "✅ Closed stale reminder issues: $STALE_REMINDERS"
  fi

  # 1b. Clean up orphaned worktrees from crashed previous runs
  REPO=$(git worktree list | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
  PRTREES="$HOME/.cursor/worktrees/$(basename "$REPO")"
  STALE_WT=$(git worktree list --porcelain \
    | grep "^worktree " | awk '{print $2}' \
    | grep -v "^$REPO$" \
    | grep "$PRTREES" \
    | grep -v "conductor")
  if [ -n "$STALE_WT" ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Orphaned worktrees detected:"
    echo "$STALE_WT"
    echo "$STALE_WT" | xargs -I{} git -C "$REPO" worktree remove --force {} 2>/dev/null || true
    git -C "$REPO" worktree prune
    echo "✅ Orphaned worktrees cleaned up"
  fi

STEP 2 — QUERY GITHUB PIPELINE STATE:
  # Build a complete picture of the pipeline from GitHub labels.
  # Do not assume — derive everything from live GitHub state.

  echo "=== OPEN ISSUES BY PHASE/BATCH ==="
  if [ -n "$PHASE_FILTER" ]; then
    gh issue list --repo "$GH_REPO" --label "$PHASE_FILTER" --state open \

STEP 3 — RESOLVE DEPENDENCY GRAPH:

    PHASE_OPEN[$phase]=$COUNT
    echo "  $phase: $COUNT open issues"
  done

  # Phase ordering groups (a group must fully close before the next group starts):
  # Group A: phase-1 → phase-2 → phase-3
  # Group B: phase-4 → phase-5

  # The ACTIVE phase in each group is the lowest-numbered phase with open issues.

STEP 4 — HUMAN APPROVAL GATE:

  GATED=false

  # Check for phase-1 (DB schema / Alembic migrations)

    echo "   Review gated items manually, then re-run the conductor."
  fi

STEP 5 — DISPATCH COORDINATORS:
  # Dispatch ISSUE_TO_PR and PR_REVIEW coordinators SIMULTANEOUSLY.
  # Use the Task tool to launch them in parallel — no need to wait for one before
  # starting the other.

  # ── ISSUE_TO_PR: dispatch if there are ready issues ──────────────────────────
  if [ "${#READY_ISSUES[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "Dispatching ISSUE_TO_PR coordinator for ${#READY_ISSUES[@]} issues..."

STEP 6 — COLLECT COORDINATOR REPORTS:
  # Wait for all dispatched coordinators to report back.
  # Each coordinator must provide artifact proof:
  #   ISSUE_TO_PR: list of PR URLs created
  #   PR_REVIEW:   list of PRs merged + grades

  # Verify no coordinator reported an empty artifact list.
  # "Done" without PR URLs or merge status = failure.

  # If a coordinator self-destructed with a D/F grade report:
  #   - Note the failed PR URL in this conductor's report.
  #   - Do NOT block the pipeline on it — other batches continue.
  #   - The rejected PR stays open; note it in the reminder issue.

STEP 7 — REMINDER GATE:
  # After collecting all reports, determine if work remains.

  REMAINING_ISSUES=$(gh issue list --repo "$GH_REPO" --state open \
    --json labels --jq '[.[] | select(.labels | map(.name) | any(startswith("phase-")))] | length' \

    # Build a pipeline status summary for the reminder body
    STATUS_BODY="## Pipeline Status — $(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC')

**Open issues:** $REMAINING_ISSUES
**Open PRs:** $REMAINING_PRS
**Conductor run:** attempt $(( ATTEMPT_N + 1 ))

### What to do next
Re-run the conductor by pasting the kickoff prompt from \`.cursor/PARALLEL_CONDUCTOR.md\`
into a new Cursor composer window rooted in the conductor worktree.

### Open issues by phase
$(for phase in "phase-1/db-schema" "phase-2/core-api" "phase-3/api-extensions" \
     "phase-4/new-ui-pages" "phase-5/ui-enhancements" \
     "phase-6/seed-data" "phase-7/machine-access"; do
  COUNT=$(gh issue list --repo "$GH_REPO" --label "$phase" --state open \
    --json number --jq 'length' 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  [ "$COUNT" -gt 0 ] && echo "- $phase: $COUNT open issues"
done)

### Gated items (require human sign-off before conductor can proceed)
$(gh issue list --repo "$GH_REPO" --label "phase-1/db-schema" --state open \
  --json number,title --jq '.[] | "- Issue #\(.number): \(.title)"' 2>/dev/null || true)

### Failed PRs (D/F grade — not merged, needs human review)
$(gh pr list --repo "$GH_REPO" --state open \
  --json number,title --jq '.[] | "- PR #\(.number): \(.title)"' 2>/dev/null | head -5 || true)
"

    REMINDER_URL=$(gh issue create \
      --repo "$GH_REPO" \
      --title "⏰ Conductor reminder — pipeline incomplete ($(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d'))" \
      --body "$STATUS_BODY")
    gh issue edit "$REMINDER_URL" --add-label "conductor-reminder" 2>/dev/null || true
    echo "✅ Reminder created: $REMINDER_URL"
    echo "   Re-run the conductor when coordinators have completed their work."
  else
    echo ""
    echo "✅ Pipeline is fully idle. No open issues or PRs with phase labels."
    echo "   All batches are implemented and merged. Well done."
    echo "   Push new GitHub issues with phase/batch labels to start the next development cycle."
  fi

STEP 8 — SELF-DESTRUCT:
  REPO=$(git worktree list | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
  WORKTREE=$(pwd)
  cd "$REPO"
  git worktree remove --force "$WORKTREE"
  git worktree prune

Report: pipeline state table (open issues by phase, open PRs, reminder URL if created).
⚠️  "Done" without the pipeline state table is not acceptable.
```

---

## Label Pre-flight (add conductor-reminder label once)

Run this once to add the `conductor-reminder` label before the first conductor run.

```bash
export GH_REPO=cgcardona/maestro

gh label create "conductor-reminder" \
  --repo "$GH_REPO" \
  --color "e4e669" \
  --description "Open: pipeline incomplete — re-run PARALLEL_CONDUCTOR.md" \
  2>/dev/null || true

echo "✅ conductor-reminder label ready"
```

---

## Taxonomy of failure modes this conductor guards against

These are patterns from real multi-agent systems. The conductor addresses each:

| Failure Mode | Guard |
|---|---|
| Orphaned subagent (child spins, parent unaware) | STEP 1: orphan worktree cleanup before every run |
| Recursive thinking loop (plan, never execute) | STEP 0: ATTEMPT_N > 3 → abort and escalate |
| Spec drift (parent updates, child continues old spec) | Conductor reads canonical prompts by file path — always current |
| Semantic telephone (intent mutates across hops) | `.agent-task` is the spec; coordinators read it directly — no retelling |
| False completion ("Done" with no artifact) | STEP 6: coordinator reports must include PR URLs or merge status |
| Context drift after summarization | Conductor re-reads `.agent-task` at each STEP (no state in memory) |
| Watchdog chain paradox (who watches the watchdog?) | Conductor reminder issue is the external signal; human is the top watchdog |
| Cross-agent race conditions | Phase ordering + FILE_OWNERSHIP in task files — same as before |
| Gated dependency deadlock | STEP 4: human approval gate surfaces gated items explicitly |

---

## After agents complete

1. Pull dev and confirm it reflects the merged PRs.
2. Check `git worktree list` — should show only the main repo.
3. Check for `conductor-reminder` issues. If one exists, re-run the conductor.

```bash
REPO=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
git -C "$REPO" fetch origin && git -C "$REPO" merge origin/dev
git worktree list
gh issue list --repo cgcardona/maestro --label "conductor-reminder" --state open
```
